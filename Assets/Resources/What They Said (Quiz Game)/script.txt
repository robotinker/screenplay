(Elana looks excited)
We've got a very special game planned for you today!
We're gonna figure out just how well you know each other!
I'm gonna start by asking a question, which each of you will answer <i>secretly</i>...
Then each of you will have a chance to guess what you thought the other people said!
(Elana looks happy)
Each correct guess will get you a point!
(Elana looks normal)
We'll do 3 rounds of 3 questions each.

That's it for Round 1!
You're all doing great, but $pMax.Score is in the lead with $Max.Score points!

So much for Round 2!
Okay, so $pMax.Score is currently in the lead with $Max.Score points, but it's still anyone's game!
Even $pMin.Score could win, and they only have $Min.Score points! :P
